##  This is the configuration file for dcm.pl
##  
##  Overview:
##    Hopefully the options available are self-explanitory.
##  
##  Syntax:
##    The syntax of this file is fairly tolerant.  Each section starts with [section]
##    and configuration settings are specified in "key => value" pairs.
##    Comments are permitted anywhere in the file - see the comments section below.
##  
##  Comments:
##    Comments either begin with a pound (#) or double slashes (//) and continue
##    to the end of the line, or they can be C's block style comments (/* */).
##    Pounds can be escaped with a backslash.

[networking]
    
    ## Web server to connect to. Examples:
    #url                     => http://yourona.server.example.com/dcm.php
    url                      => http://localhost/dcm.php
    
    ## If an https:// url is specified above, this option will allow
    ## dcm.pl to fallback to an http connection if your perl installation
    ## doesn't support ssl, or the web server doesn't accept https 
    ## connections.  Note that when this fallback occurs a warning 
    ## message is printed to STDERR.
    ## (1 = yes, 0 = no)
    allow-http-fallback      => 1
    
    ## Basic HTTP Authentication
    # By default not specifying a user here will cause the username to be
    # dcm.pl.  This username would need to be configured in ONA and granted
    # proper access.  You can always pass the -l and -p CLI options or
    # use the DCM_LOGIN_USER and DCM_LOGIN_PASS ENV variables.
    #
    # Use local unix username as the login
    #login                    => $conf{'unix_username'}
    #
    // login                  => username
    // passwd                 => password
    
    ## timeouts for any/all network connections (360 seconds)
    timeout                  => 360

[logging]
    
    ## print to STDOUT (can work in conjunction with "syslog" and "logfile")
    stdout                   => 1
    
    ## log to syslogd (can work in conjunction with "stdout" and "logfile")
    syslog                   => 0
    
    ## syslog facility (1/USER is the default)
    facility                 => 1
    
    ## enable logging to the specified file (can work in conjunction with "syslog" and "stdout")
    // logFile                  => /var/log/dcm
